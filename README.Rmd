A [Faker API](https://fakerapi.it/en) wrapper package in R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of faker from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("judith-bourque/faker")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to get a person using the Faker API:

```{r example}
library(faker)

str(faker_person("male"))
```

This package includes a ggplot2 theme inspired by the Faker API:

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("faker")

mtcars2 <- within(mtcars, {
vs <- factor(vs, labels = c("V-shaped", "Straight"))
am <- factor(am, labels = c("Automatic", "Manual"))
cyl  <- factor(cyl)
gear <- factor(gear)
})

p1 <- ggplot(mtcars2) +
geom_point(aes(x = wt, y = mpg, colour = gear)) +
  labs(
    title = "Fuel economy declines as weight increases",
    subtitle = "(1973-74)",
    caption = "Data from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine.",
    tag = "Figure 1",
    x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
    y = "Fuel economy (mpg)",
    colour = "Gears"
  )

p1 + theme_custom()
```

## About

\`faker\` is based on [`httr2`](https://httr2.r-lib.org) and built using the workflow outlined in [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org).
